# Maskfashion Site WIP


This site is built on Svelte, data is served by Airtable, and hosted on Surge.

The Airtable API and Base keys are public, because it's using an external read-only user's API. To replicate this in your own project, invite a new Airtable user to your base with "read only" status, and use that user's API key.
