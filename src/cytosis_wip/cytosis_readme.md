# Cytosis


#### Caution
Cytosis is a very early prototype. Use with caution, as it might overwrite everything in your Airtable... so keep backups

Cytosis uses airtable as a simple CMS for static websites.


## How it should work

- Import Cytosis using npm into existing projects 
- Include cytosis.js with a CDN or locally into static sites and platforms like Squarespace and Wordpress


## Usage

- add example 
- [add usage notes here]


## Production Notes

- Use webpack `npm run build` to create a single JS file for CDNs or local file import w/o the need for Node. 
- Publish a demo site on surge w/ link to surge asset as CDN
- Publish changes as npm modules for easy npm integration












  - Added to new npm package 9/12
  
  - made lots of functions static
  - added dynamic rows to init, can specify what row in _cytosis to pull from now
  - changed from .get() to .fields[] to get away from using the prototype
  - added getFieldValues
  - changed search() to comb through multiple list of strings
  - added getNames to get flat list of row names
  - started to add better comments on functions w/ input/output
  - changed key/base names to airKey and airBase
  - made get() synchronous
  - added linked column search to Find(), e.g. TableName.RecordName.ColName.LinkedColName
  - changed split / unsplit behavior to not affect user too much
    - user still has to save each new split field to Airtable
    - can now unsplit Airtable data and data will appear "normal"
  - changed the way getTables is accessed: takes a single object arg now
  - changed _cytosis column from 'Items' to 'Tables' -> will be severely breaking


  - 2/17/2019
    - tableNames changed to tableQuery
    - added multiple querying — given a list of queries in LinkedQueryNames "_content, _tags", will pull data from both queries
    - added better support for views/formulas/filters

  - 7/15/2019
    - added partial matching; set the single select field matchStyle to "partial" to partially match a keyword 
    - changed the poorly named "settings" attribute to "payloads" so it's less confusing between options and settings 

  - 7/21/2019
    - added some experimental (nonfunctional) code for introspecting / finding empty fields
    - added a static cleanTable transformation function that takes a table and only keeps fields and id

  - 8/14/2019
    - added setup() to compartmentalize initialization;
    - added a way to send a config object to bypass hitting airtable for _config so much
    - added airtableFetch to add throttling for fetching, but holding off

  - 8/16/2019
    - added error for find/findOne fields not being an array

  - 8/23/2019
    - added a delay to fetchnextpage to reduce hitting limits
    - added some better error output; testing silent error for fetch
    - added a "routeName" component, for routeName, tracing bugs etc.
    - added a helper method to just retrieve cytosis configs

  - 8/26/2019
    - added getConfig to only get the _cytosis config data


  - 8/27/2019
    - added findField as a finder/getter

  - 8/30/2019
    - added strip, which retains fields, id, and core parts of a cytosis object
    - added a filter helper, 'filter_or'

  - 8/31/2019
    - added getRecord that uses Airtable API's "find" method
    - added cleanRecord that only keeps id, fields, and some of _table from a record

  - 9/1/2019
    - fixed save () and delete; saveLinkedTables probably needs a fixin' too

  - 9/4/2019
    - added a typecast option to class and static save ()
    - added saveArray and reverted old save () to how it used to be; save Array uses the new API
    - update airtable dep to 0.7.1
    - also consider a real CHANGELOG.md lol

  - 9/10/2019
    - added a condition in init when not sending a tableQuery (just want a base obj)

  - 9/20/2019
    - added a simpler way of getting record ID by supplying a base object

  Cytosis CMS (cytosis)

    - Cytosis grabs and stores/caches data. Very useful for Airtable.
      - Turns Airtable-centric into a light static CMS like Contentful

    - Cytosis currently WRAPS THE Airtable API!
      - The Airtable API is kind of huge
      - future: localstorage and mLab/mongo/firebase
        - for offline access
        - for multiple devices

    - so in the future some of these should be separated
    - getLinkedRecords should be static






  Future / roadmap

    - Build a vue plugin kind of like: https://github.com/vuejs/vuefire/tree/firestore
    - possible to do a last changed time stamp, and changed by who and ID number stored in _cytosis metadata
      - can do things like simple change tracking etc.
    - preload — specify which tables to load first, which to defer
      - load the content tables in first, and the massive data later
      - also can load contextual metadata (like what page is it, where to get resources, etc.)
    - static — specify which tables are static / won't change much
      - used for static page generation that speeds up page loads
    - cytosis controller table
      - can use this to variably set other table names w/o hard coding
    - front-end wrapper
      - jquery, non-vue getter
        - maybe extend jquery prototype?
        - maybe have another 'helper' class or set of functions that don't belong to regular Cytosis?
      - public API key
      - extensible version of the atlx experiment
    - keepAlive syncing / polling w/ Airtable (not fully reactive like Meteor 
      - but can sync+cache at 5 ticks/sec
      - webtask can sync/cache at 1 tick/sec
    - add fetch / delayed retrieval for some tables (also maybe in _cytosis as a separate row)
      - idea is we don't always want to grab everything from Airtable; some huge tables are better put off til needed
    - cytosis webtask (for public interfaces)
    - make easier to specify '_cytosis' or supply an array of data:{ [tableNames] }
    - clean up and unify schema
    - partial downloads: can set some to be deferred to be downloaded until needed (makes initial site load faster)
      - partial table downloads, e.g. for searching, so not as much data needs to be pulled
    - support prisma API / support partial downlaods from graphql
    - support firebase
    - 

  Bugs

    - SaveLinkedTable, if save clicked multiple times, doesn't check for duplicates already added, so can potentially add several of the same tags
      - probably the source needs to refresh, not sure if cytosis could fix it
      - this has to be done:: (local needs to be refreshed) this.cytosis.tables.Tags = this.tags // refresh local tags store


  Thoughts / Ideas / Notes / Done

    - using airtableobject.get('Name') doesn't always work, since sometimes the prototype doesn't get preserved
      - this is true w/ Nuxt 'Universal' (static) mode

  "Docs"


  - Getting Started - 

    Cytosis is for using Airtable as a prototype CMS
    Core user data is best not stored using this system. Use something like auth0 or firebase instead.

    Best for Public Content
      - Sometimes you want to display content from a CMS. Cytosis turns Airtable into one.
      - Create a separate user with view-only access, and use its API key as the cytosis API key
        - The key is used the exact same way as a regular key, except create/update/delete will throw errors 
      - Ex: Website content, blog content, news articles, lists or browsable data like bookmarks or store data

    For Private content, use sparingly
      - Passworded sites and local apps can hardcode the API key (airKey) directly in cytosis
      - KEEP IN MIND that cytosis code is visible in the code inspector. 
      - One way to guard against this is for users to enter their Airtable API key and Base ID manually
      - You can also use a serverless function as authentication, and provide the API and Base after authentication

    Private/Public Content
      - Any sites w/ functionality to update Airtable as well as read from Airtable for the masses
      - If there's a login system, you can create a handler that retrieves a user's private API key and load it into their system
        - the privateKeyHandler is just a convenient place to store the serverless URL that retrieves this data
      - Semi-private: Todo lists, shopping lists — apps that run on a public machine, but users have edit access to their own repo
        - Retrieve the private API key from a server or external system after login
      - Public-private: Feedback forms, rating systems, commenting systems, interactive projects — users can all edit the same data repository will require an external server handler
        - Use a public API for read, and process create/update/delete requests via an external handler

    // init Cytosis
    const cytosis = await new Cytosis({
      airKey: 'key value' — if used on front-end projects, make sure it's on a separate airtable account w/ read-only permissions!!
      airBase: {
        id: 'Airtable Base ID key', 
        tables: [array of table names]} — optional; otherwise looks for _cytosis table, w/ a column called Items w/ multiple select
    })

    You can also:

    1. Either set a default Base and Key for Cytosis object itself
    2. myCytosis = await new Cytosis({airKey: '123', airBase: '123'}) — defaults to looking for _cytosis table
    3. myCytosis = await new Cytosis({airKey: '123', airBase: '123', tables: ['table1','table2']}) — just reads/caches the given tables
    4. myCytosis = await new Cytosis({airKey: '123', airBase: '123', tableQuery: 'tableName'}) — tableName is the name of the table index row in _cytosis. You can add Items to the custom table name for dynamic loading
    4. myCytosis = await new Cytosis({airKey: '123', airBase: '123', tableQuery: 'tableName'}, {view: 'Grid View'}) — you can also specify an Airtable API options object w/ view, fields, sort, filter

    // Airtable options: filter is an Airtable filter formula https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference

    // Cytosis loads tables from _cytosis table instead of hard-coded
    // create a row w/ Name="tableNames" and a Multiple Select called 'Items' with the table names

    // After initialization, the myCytosis.tables will contain all loaded tables 

  - Usage -

    cytosis.get('recordId')
    // returns a promise of data of a single record
    // useful when you have an array of recordIds

    cytosis.getTables(options={}, tables=this.airBase.tables)
    // returns a promise of data of a single record
    // {options} are: view, fields, sort, filter, per the Airtable API
    // [tables] is an array of table names (default is to retrieve whatever has been initiated)

    cytosis.save(object, tableName, recordId=undefined)
    // {object} is the object you want saved. Fields must match those of the table or not be defined
    // 'tableName' is the name of the table you're saving your object to
    // 'recordId' lets you update an existing record. Unfortunately you still have to supply the tableName per the API

    cytosis.delete(tableName, recordId)
    // 'tableName' is the name of the table to delete your object from. API requires you to state tableName
    // 'recordId' is the record to be deleted. 

  - Helpers -

    cytosis.getLinkedRecords(recordIds, linkedTable, getObj=false)
    // airtable excels at creating links between records. These links are stored as arrays of recordIds
    // this converts the linked records to an array of Names (for Tags this is sufficient)
    // if you need the entire objects, set getObj to true
    // [recordIds] is an array of links (e.g. a list of tag references to the Tags table)
    // 'linkedTable' is the table name e.g. 'Tags' where the records are stored

    cytosis.split(saveObject, key, maxChunks=4)
    // this one splits huge objects (stringified > 100,000 chars) across multiple columns
    // e.g. an object to be stored in key _data gets split into _data _data-1 _data-2
    // the table needs to have those extra columns created in Airtable, so this requires some planning 
    // {saveObject} is the object you want to store
    // 'key' is something like _data 

    cytosis.unsplit(record, key)
    // {record} is the actual record object from Airtable (not a record Id)
    // 'key' is the what you want to unsplit (e.g. '_data' from the above example)

## Todo


### Others
- add a refresh method to refresh the store
- add offline mode / caching and resync mode 

- add a github page w/ docs
- add to github :]
- add babel
- add node builder for babel for CDN version?
- https://github.com/bookercodes/articles/blob/master/how-to-build-and-publish-es6-npm-modules-today-with-babel.md
- example scripts and write-up / documentation pages
- CDN version / hosted on surge
  - remember to check the CDN / cross site host thing
- example airtable templates
  - along with how to share/import templates to your own airtable
- example on serverless scripts for public/private examples (e.g. anonymous commenting)
  - technically should NOT be a part of cytosis, but a webtask example on auth and returning a private key is useful
  - webtask example of running cytosis on webtask using npm modules and relaying data
- add examples on Glitch
- the examples should really be under another project, not under the npm module folder at least...

## Production Notes
